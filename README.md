This project is a report of a recent artivle in biological or biomedical study that uses one or more of the statistical methods. 
This project covers four sections listed below: 
1. Summarize the study. (e.g. What was the study design? How many subjects were enrolled? How were they sampled? What was the primary outcome?
What other covariates did they measure? What did they find?)
2. Critique the methods used. (e.g. What methods did they use in this study? What assumptions did they make (explicitly or implicitly)? Might there have been any violations of these assumptions? What other methods could they have used? What are the advantages and disadvantages of their approach compared to other possible
approaches?)
3. Replicate their results. If they fit several models or investigated several different outcomes, you can choose just one model/outcome.
4. Conduct the analysis using a different approach (i.e. one of the approaches you suggest in part 2). Explain how your results compare to the original results.
